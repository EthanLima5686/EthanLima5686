### **Hello and welcome to my Github profile!**

I am currently learning Python and Javascript!<br>
I like to collaborate with others on projects such as a Java animation project (ENGG1420Final) I did with a few of my classmates in the first year.

Currently, I am working on mini projects utilizing JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, and C.
